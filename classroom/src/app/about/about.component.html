  DocuScope is a text analysis environment with a suite of interactive
  visualization tools for corpus-based rhetorical
  analysis. The
  <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/research/docuscope.html">DocuScope Project</a>
  began in 1998 as a result of collaboration between David
  Kaufer and Suguru Ishizaki at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie
  Mellon University</a>. David created what we call the generic
  (default) dictionary, consisting of over 40 million linguistic
  patterns of English classified into over 100 categories of
  rhetorical effects. Suguru designed and implemented the analysis and
  visualization software, which can annotate a corpus of text against
  any dictionary of regular strings that are classified into a
  hierarchy of rhetorical effects. While we designed DocuScope as a
  tool for rhetorical analysis, we also found that it was extremely
  effective for developing the dictionary in a systematic fashion.
