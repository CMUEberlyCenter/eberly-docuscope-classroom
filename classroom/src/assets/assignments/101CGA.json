 "intro": "This document is your own personalized report of how your language choices/writing choices have been analyzed by the text analysis tool, Docuscope. You will use this report to understand how you expressed the core features of this assignment and to compare your expression with a peer's. The first section of the report shows how your many language choices have worked together to form identifiable, targeted moves for your Comparative Genre Analysis Essay. The boxplots should help you visualize the number of instances that you used language to craft moves that point your reader toward your rhetorical purpose.",

 "stv_intro": "In this next section of your personalized report, you will see four particular categories identified within the context of your own writing: comparison, citation that shows authority, citation that shows controversy, and citation that appears neutral. These categories are what we consider to be \"core\" for the CGA task, but they can be expressed in different ways by different writers--and they blend with other compositional moves to express your unique perspective on how writers convey arguments to expert and nonexpert audiences."
