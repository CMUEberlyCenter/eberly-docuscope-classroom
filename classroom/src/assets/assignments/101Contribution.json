  "intro": "This document is your own personalized report of how your language choices/writing choices have been analyzed by the text analysis tool, Docuscope. You will use this report to understand how you expressed the core features of this assignment and to compare your expression with a peer's. The first section of the report shows how your many language choices have worked together to form identifiable, targeted moves for your Contribution Essay. The boxplots should help you visualize the number of instances that you used language to craft moves that point your reader toward your rhetorical purpose of arguing for a way to resolve a problem you've identified as a gap within an existing conversation.",

  "stv_intro": "In this next section of your personalized report, you will see some categories you've seen before (citation, CARS moves, confidence, first-person, inquiry, and reasoning). This time, for \"reasoning,\" pay attention to whether there are instances in which you are using reasoning language to discuss another perspective or a \"naysayer.\" These categories are what we consider to be \"core\" for the Contribution task, but they can be expressed in different ways by different writers--and they blend with other compositional moves to express your unique perspective on how writers convey arguments to expert and nonexpert audiences. Just as you compared your Proposal and CGA paper with your peers, you'll do the same with your Contribution."
