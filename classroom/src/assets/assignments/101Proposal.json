  "intro": "This document is your own personalized report of how your language choices/writing choices have been analyzed by the text analysis tool, Docuscope. You will use this report to understand how you expressed the core features of this assignment and to compare your expression with a peer's. The first section of the report shows how your many language choices have worked together to form identifiable, targeted moves for your Contribution Research Proposal. The boxplots should help you visualize the number of instances that you used language to craft moves that point your reader toward your rhetorical purpose of identifying a problem within an existing academic conversation and outlining a research plan to resolve that problem.",

  "stv_intro": "In this next section of your personalized report, you will see these particular categories identified within the context of your own writing: metadiscourse and the use of \"I\" (similar to navigational language discussed in Graff and Birkenstein's \"Connecting the Parts\" and \"The Art of Metacommentary\"); reasoning language that shows logical connections; inquiry language that points to investigation and research processes; language that references differing levels of confidence and certainty. These categories are what we consider to be \"core\" for the Proposal task, but they can be expressed in different ways by different writers--and they blend with other compositional moves to express your unique perspective on how writers convey arguments to expert and nonexpert audiences. Just as you compared your CGA paper with your peers, you'll do the same with your proposal."
