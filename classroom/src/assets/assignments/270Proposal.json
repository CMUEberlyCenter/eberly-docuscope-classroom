"intro": "This document is your own personalized report of how your language and writing choices have been analyzed by the text analysis tool, Docuscope. You will use this report to understand how you expressed the core features of this assignment and to compare your expression with a peer's. This first section of the report shows how your many language choices have worked together to form identifiable, targeted moves for your Proposal. The boxplots should help you visualize the number of instances that you used language to craft moves that point your reader toward your rhetorical purpose. The boxplots can also be used as the basis for a comparison between your text and your peer's. For example, if your paper has significantly more \"Future\"-oriented language than your peer's, it may be interesting to locate and compare how you both are using it in your text.",

"stv_intro": "In this next section of your personalized report, you will see the particular categories outlined above identified within the context of your own writing. These categories are what we consider to be \"core\" for the task of writing a Proposal, but they can be expressed in different ways by different writers--and they blend with other compositional moves to accomplish the purpose of your document."
